HOW TO PLAY:

The game is a two player game, where each player has to connect four pieces of the same color in a row, column or diagonal.

At first, you will be prompted to insert the players' names, and each player will be assigned a symbol (X or O).

For each turn the play board will be displayed, and the player will be prompted to insert the column where he wants to place his piece.

The game will end when one of the players connects four pieces in a row, column or diagonal, or when the board is full.
